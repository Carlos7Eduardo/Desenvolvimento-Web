                Somebody once told me<br>
                The world is gonna roll me<br>
                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
                She was looking kind of dumb<br>
                With her finger and her thumb<br>
                In the shape of an L on her forehead <br>

                Well, the years start coming<br>
                And they don't stop coming<br>
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
                Your brain gets smart<br>
                But your head gets dumb<br>

                So much to do, so much to see<br>
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
                You'll never know if you don't go<br>
                You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>

                Hey now, you're an all star<br>
                Get your game on, go play<br>
                Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
                Get the show on, get paid<br>
                And all that glitters is gold<br>
                Only shooting stars break the mold<br>

                It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
                You're bundled up now<br>
                But wait till you get older<br>
                But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
                Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>

                The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
                The water is getting warm<br>
                So you might as well swim<br>
                My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
                That's the way I like it<br>
                And I never get bored<br>

                Hey now, you're an all star<br>
                Get your game on, go play<br>
                Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
                Get the show on, get paid<br>
                And all that glitters is gold<br>
                Only shooting stars break the mold<br>

                Hey now, you're an all star<br>
                Get your game on, go play<br>
                Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
                Get the show on, get paid<br>
                And all that glitters is gold<br>
                Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
